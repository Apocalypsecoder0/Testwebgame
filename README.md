A turn-based strategy (TBS) game is a strategy game (usually some type of wargame, especially a strategic-level wargame) where players take turns when playing.

BBS door games are computer games played on bulletin board systems. [1] These games were often called "doors," "chains," or "externals" because they were external applications that ran outside of the main BBS program.
